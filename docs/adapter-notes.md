# Adapter Notes

Adapters are future work. V1 defines the portable degree format and manual resolution behavior only.

## Generic Prompt-Only Usage

A generic adapter can concatenate:

1. The selected degree markdown body.
2. A short list of included skill ids.
3. A short list of recommended tools, grouped by kind.
4. A soft-exclusion note.
5. A reminder that excluded skills may be loaded with explicit user request or concrete evidence.

This works even when the agent runtime has no formal skill system.

## Cursor

A Cursor adapter could translate a selected degree into a prompt prelude or project rule. It should not mutate installed rules automatically. The safest first version would generate text the user can review and paste into the relevant Cursor instruction surface.

If the degree recommends tools, Cursor output should describe them as preferred evidence sources or commands. It should not assume MCPs or CLIs are configured unless the local environment confirms them.

## Claude Code

A Claude Code adapter could emit an instruction prelude plus a list of local skill or command references. It should keep soft exclusions advisory and avoid hiding files or disabling tools.

Recommended CLIs can be rendered as suggested commands or tool preferences. Recommended MCPs should be rendered only when the adapter can map the portable id to a configured MCP server.

## Codex

A Codex adapter could map `includeSkills` to available Codex skills when ids match, then add the degree body as a task-local focus instruction. If a matching skill is unavailable, the adapter should report the missing id rather than silently substituting unrelated context.

Recommended tools can map to Codex MCP tools, shell CLIs, browser tools, or app connectors. Missing tools should be reported explicitly, and installations should remain user-approved.

## Resolver Output Shape

A future resolver can produce a small bundle:

```json
{
  "degreeId": "frontend-engineer",
  "confidence": 0.78,
  "includeSkills": ["react-best-practices", "frontend-design", "browser-verification"],
  "recommendedTools": [
    {
      "id": "browser",
      "kind": "mcp",
      "purpose": "Inspect and verify user-visible behavior in a real browser."
    },
    {
      "id": "npm",
      "kind": "package-manager",
      "purpose": "Run frontend scripts such as typecheck, lint, test, and build."
    }
  ],
  "softExcludeSkills": ["backend-patterns", "database-migrations"],
  "reason": "Task mentions TSX files, layout, and accessibility.",
  "prompt": "You are operating under the Frontend Engineer degree..."
}
```

This is an adapter contract sketch, not a committed runtime API.
