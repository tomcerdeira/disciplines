# Adapter Notes

Runtime adapters are future work. V1 defines the portable discipline format, local prompt-only resolution, and manual adapter behavior only.

## Shared Loading Model

Adapters should mirror skill-style progressive disclosure:

1. Read lightweight metadata for every discipline package: folder id, `name`, `description`, `activation`, aliases, and thresholds.
2. Resolve the task to `select`, `compose`, `ask`, or `none`.
3. Load the full body only for selected discipline packages.
4. Map `includeSkills` and `recommendedTools` to runtime-specific skills, tools, MCPs, CLIs, or commands.
5. Load full skill bodies, tool docs, or adapter-specific resources only after that mapping shows they are relevant.

Do not concatenate every discipline body into the initial prompt. The discipline layer should reduce context before the skill layer expands it.

For lightweight invocation without a real runtime adapter, use [invocation.md](invocation.md).

## Generic Prompt-Only Usage

The built-in prompt-only adapter is:

```sh
npm run resolve -- --task "Fix keyboard navigation" --file src/components/SearchResults.tsx
```

It first considers the available discipline metadata, then prints:

1. The selected discipline markdown body.
2. A short list of included skill ids.
3. A short list of recommended tools, grouped by kind.
4. A short explanation of matched activation signals when useful.
5. A soft-exclusion note.
6. A reminder that excluded skills may be loaded with explicit user request or concrete evidence.

This works even when the agent runtime has no formal skill system.

Use `--format json` when another adapter needs structured output instead of copy-paste markdown.

## Cursor

A Cursor adapter could translate a selected discipline into a prompt prelude or project rule. It should not mutate installed rules automatically. The safest first version would generate text the user can review and paste into the relevant Cursor instruction surface.

Cursor output should be generated from selected discipline packages only. Discipline metadata can be indexed broadly, but full discipline bodies should stay out of the prompt until selected.

If the discipline recommends tools, Cursor output should describe them as preferred evidence sources or commands. It should not assume MCPs or CLIs are configured unless the local environment confirms them.

V1 usage: run `npm run resolve -- ...` and paste the prompt output above the Cursor task.

## Claude Code

A Claude Code adapter could emit an instruction prelude plus a list of local skill or command references. It should keep soft exclusions advisory and avoid hiding files or disabling tools.

It should resolve from discipline metadata first, then load only the selected `DISCIPLINE.md` body before suggesting local skills or commands.

Recommended CLIs can be rendered as suggested commands or tool preferences. Recommended MCPs should be rendered only when the adapter can map the portable id to a configured MCP server.

V1 usage: run `npm run resolve -- ...` and paste the prompt output before the Claude Code task.

## Codex

A Codex adapter could map `includeSkills` to available Codex skills when ids match, then add the discipline body as a task-local focus instruction. If a matching skill is unavailable, the adapter should report the missing id rather than silently substituting unrelated context.

Codex already exposes skill metadata before loading skill bodies. A Codex discipline adapter should do the same for discipline metadata: select the discipline first, load its body second, and then load mapped skill bodies only as needed.

Recommended tools can map to Codex MCP tools, shell CLIs, browser tools, or app connectors. Missing tools should be reported explicitly, and installations should remain user-approved.

V1 usage: run `npm run resolve -- ...` and paste the prompt output into the Codex task, or use the JSON output as an adapter input.

## Resolver Output Shape

The local resolver and future adapters can produce a small bundle:

```json
{
  "decision": "select",
  "selectedDisciplines": [
    {
      "id": "frontend-engineer",
      "role": "primary",
      "confidence": 0.78
    }
  ],
  "activationMatches": [
    {
      "disciplineId": "frontend-engineer",
      "pathPatterns": ["**/*.tsx"],
      "commandPatterns": [],
      "promptSignals": ["TSX files", "layout", "accessibility"]
    }
  ],
  "includeSkills": ["react-best-practices", "frontend-design", "browser-verification"],
  "recommendedTools": [
    {
      "id": "browser",
      "kind": "mcp",
      "purpose": "Inspect and verify user-visible behavior in a real browser."
    },
    {
      "id": "package-manager",
      "kind": "package-manager",
      "purpose": "Run the repository's configured frontend scripts such as typecheck, lint, test, and build."
    }
  ],
  "softExcludeSkills": ["backend-patterns", "database-migrations"],
  "reason": "Task mentions TSX files, layout, and accessibility.",
  "prompt": "You are operating under the Frontend Engineer discipline..."
}
```

This is an adapter contract sketch, not a runtime enforcement API.
